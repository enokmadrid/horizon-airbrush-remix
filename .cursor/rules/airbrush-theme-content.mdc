# Airbrush Theme Content + Data Model

This rule attaches the core PRD for the airbrush theme so AI work on theme Liquid and JS always respects the data model.

Read the full PRD here:  
[Airbrush Theme PRD](mdc:.cursor/prd/airbrush-theme-content.md)

## What this PRD defines

- Design category collections and item collections.
- Metaobjects for:
  - Items
  - Size options
  - Font styles
  - Color options
  - Background patterns
  - Extras
- Product metafields under the `customization` namespace.
- Price builder rules:
  - No Shopify variants
  - All pricing comes from metaobjects + metafields
  - Cart line item properties must capture all selections and final price.

When generating or editing:

- Liquid templates for product pages and sections.
- JS/TS for price calculation and cart behavior.

Use the PRD as the source of truth.
